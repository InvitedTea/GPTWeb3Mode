Use ChatGPT and Web3 updated knowledge base to help L2 dev productivity and boost the ecosystem.

### 1. **Defining Objectives and Scope**
Challenge: The L2 chains are new and evolving rapidly, which can overwhelm newcomers and experts.
Limitation of Current Tools: ChatGPT doesn't provide the most recent two years of knowledge.
Solution: I built ChatGPT with a curated knowledge base to help developers to get more productivity and efficiency and grow our ecosystem for L2.
   - **Target Audience:** L2 developers, enthusiasts, and anyone interested in the decentralized technology ecosystem.(done)

### 2. **How it works**

   - Streamlit Python allow fast app dev
   - Scrape github L2 OP, base and mode tech docs as quick PoC
   - Use LangChain doc/files embedding and OpenAI Text-embedding-ada-002 model
   - Use ChatGPT 3.5 base model
   - Use NFT badge to auth the access to query front-end


### 3. **Future Roadmap**

   - Collect massive L2 knowledge from Github and embedded the GPT model
   - Evaluate the model performance with the community
   - Collect feedback from other features and requirements.
